    "## 1. Hybrid Model Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "GameRx uses a **hybrid recommendation model**  \n",
    "that balances **player emotion** with **psychological safety**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It answers one question only:\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do we recommend games that feel right and remain safe?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this model does\n",
    "\n",
    "- combines player review emotions (bottom-up)\n",
    "- applies therapeutic structure via genre and design (top-down)\n",
    "- uses emotion data when available\n",
    "- falls back to genre-based relief when emotion data is missing\n",
    "- assigns **one final relief pathway per game**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Player emotion informs the recommendation.  \n",
    "Therapeutic structure governs the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**\n",

    "\n",
    "GameRx organizes recommendations around **relief pathways**,  \n",

    "\n",
    "This keeps the focus on **supporting the user**,  \n",
    "not reacting to emotion intensity alone.\n",

    "\n",
    "- defines how a game supports emotional regulation\n",
    "- maps gameplay to **one of four relief pathways**\n",
    "- grounds recommendations in psychology, not vibes\n",
    "- prevents emotionally escalatory content from surfacing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎮 The four relief pathways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comfort** → calm, safety, grounding  \n",
    "- **Catharsis** → controlled release of anger  \n",
    "- **Distraction** → interrupt rumination and anxiety  \n",
    "- **Validation** → feeling seen and emotionally connected  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this layer matters\n",
    "\n",
    "High scores alone are not enough.  \n",
    "Games must align with **therapeutic intent**,  \n",
